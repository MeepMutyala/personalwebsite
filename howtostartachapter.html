                    <h3>How to Start a Chapter</h3>
                    <p>
                        So you’ve decided you want to create a TSA chapter within your school.
                        But you have no idea where to get started. That’s where I can help you. Here are the first few steps to
                        creating a new chapter, whether you’re a student or a teacher.
                    </p>
                    <ol>
                        <li><bold>Understand TSA</bold></li>
                        <p>
                            Understand the goals of this organization, and how TSA can improve student’s careers.
                            Visit the National TSA Website and learn about TSA before deciding to create a chapter.
                            Visit your state’s TSA website, and learn about who your state’s officials are.
                            This step is extremely important as understanding often lays the groundwork for any project.
                        </p>
                        <li><bold>Communicate.</bold></li>
                        <p>
                            After speaking to your school’s official(s) and/or heads, making sure you are able
                            to set up this club within your school, and finding a teacher to be an advisor, contact your State's TSA advisor and figure out the requirements to start a chapter.
                            Then spread the word! You will need students to participate in this club, and the more the merrier.
                            Dedicated students will benefit your chapter, and convincing students that are strong
                            leaders to join will help in the future for your chapter. After recruiting members, establish
                            a day each week that you all can spend working on TSA, whether it’s competitive events or contact
                            your state advisor or state officers for help on registering your chapter for the state competition
                            and on the national level.
                        </p>

                        <li><bold>Elect Chapter Officers.</bold></li>
                        <p>
                            It’s wise to start off strong in TSA, so your chapter can advance and doesn’t fall behind in the
                            future. Chapter Officers are the main leaders of your club, and they will meet to organize events and
                            make sure things are running smoothly for your chapter. You will need students to run for chapter office
                            so that they may lead your chapter to excellence. It is up to the advisor or the general members to set
                            this up, since this is your chapter’s first year. Each general member is allowed one vote. You can set
                            this election up in one of two ways:

                            <ul>
                                <li>
                                    Traditional Election/Specific Position- Each candidate runs for a specific position, and they compete
                                    against the other candidates for just that position. Each member votes for someone in each position.
                                    Candidates with the most votes for each position win that position.
                                </li>
                                <br>
                                <li>
                                    Pool Election- Each candidate runs to be a chapter officer, regardless of position. All candidates
                                    compete against one another. Each member is allowed to cast a certain number of votes, each for a
                                    different person (normally if there are 6 or more candidates, allowing each member to cast 5-6 votes
                                    will work fine.) Then after votes are tallied up, the candidate with the highest amount of votes chooses
                                    the position that they would like to serve in. Then that position is filled, and the candidate with the
                                    second highest amount of votes chooses a position, other than the position already filled. This process
                                    repeats until all positions are filled. The benefit of this option is to have a better chance of qualified
                                    candidates run for office. For example, if 4 extremely qualified candidates run for Treasurer, and 3 not as
                                    qualified candidates run for Reporter, then the chapter is missing out on 3 qualified leaders, and has a member
                                    on the team that is not as qualified. The pool system allows a chance for all of the qualified candidates to make it.
                                </li>
                            </ul>

                        <p>
                            The officer positions are listed below. For information of the roles of each position, please visit

                        <p>
                            Note: You can always form committees or let members complete certain tasks and give them a role, although they
                            will not be on the official committee. For example, my chapter has a “Social Media Manager” who looks after our
                            social media pages and manages them.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            It’s wise to contact your state advisor, and learn about how to set up your chapter, and understand how a
                            chapter should run. Visiting local schools with TSA and speaking to their members and advisors can be a huge asset
                            to creating your chapter. Contacting others can be extremely beneficial in laying groundwork for your chapter, and
                            now you have chapter officers to help out with contacting other chapters.
                        </p>

                        <li><bold> Creating a Program of Work. </bold></li>
                        <p>
                            A program of work outlines the goals, deadlines, and projects being completed in a period of time. After
                            understanding the goals and plans of other chapters, your chapter officers and advisor should meet to develop
                            a plan that has goals and projects for your chapter officers and willing members to try to complete to strengthen
                            your chapter and your chapter’s reputation in your region or state. Some examples of what you can include in your
                            program of work are:
                            <ul>
                                <li>Chapter fundraisers</li>
                                <li>ACS fundraisers</li>
                                <li>Competitive Event Checks</li>
                                <li>Relay For Life Events</li>
                            </ul>

                        <p>
                            Programs of work are beneficial to any group of people, as they create detailed projects and tasks as well as deadlines
                            for each. It’s not uncommon to not be able to complete every task on the program of work, but try your best to help carry
                            out all the tasks on the program of work, as it will improve your chapter.
                        </p>

                        <li><bold>Lead</bold></li>
                        <p>
                            After registering your chapter for your regional/state conference, work throughout the year and lead the chapter to do
                            well at the regional/state conference by working on your events and checking in on the ones chosen by your fellow members.
                            You’ve established your chapter, now follow through the program of work and try to complete each task. Promote your chapter.
                            Continue to do service and fundraising events, and reach out to other chapters. From here on out, it’s up to you and the other
                            members to decide how they will proceed with their plans for the future of your chapter. You have many resources around the
                            internet and within your state I’m sure, so good luck!
                        </p>
