                    Hello!
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    It’s been almost a year since my last post. I stopped posting because, a little over a year ago, I came across an obstacle that I thought was going to change the course of everything in my life. I didn’t have any control over it, and I felt like my world was crashing down around me. So I didn’t feel like I was in the best place to continue this blog. 
                    <br>
                    <br>	    
                    But life kept moving on. People went on with their lives, school wasn’t letting up on the work, and I was expected to continue my routine. Only I didn’t feel like it. I resisted and dwelled on the past for much too long. I thought about what went wrong and how I could have fixed it, or how far back in the past I would go to make things right. How different my life would be if I solved the issue.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Eventually, I came to realize how I wasn’t changing anything by continuing to brood over what happened. It was done, and it was set in stone. Reflecting on it is important, but not accepting what happened is not. I finally resolved to <b> keep moving forward.</b>
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    And this situation turned out not to have affected my life as negatively as I thought. Instead, it opened the door to new opportunities for me. I was able to learn and achieve much more as a result.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    It’s important to reflect, but not brood.
	            <br>
                    <br>
                    Blogs will continue to be posted bimonthly(every other month) and they will be much shorter and concise like this one hopefully was! This project is overall a reflection of my past so I can learn and understand greater than before. It’s mainly for me, but if you’re reading, thanks for being a part of it.
