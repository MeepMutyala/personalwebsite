                    <br>
                    <p>With 2018 beginning, take a moment to think about this past year.</p>
	
                    <p>As for me, I, just like anyone else, had my good times and... “not so good” times. But the good outweighs the not so good.</p> 
                    
                    <p>From the start of 2017 to the end I can tell that I’ve changed positively. I really followed the passions of 
                    mine that I didn’t explore as deeply as I wanted to, from photography to leadership to even coding and programming. 
                    I developed this sense of motivation that I didn’t find in myself before very early in the year, and I found that 
                    it improved my productivity, personal development, and outlook. I became healthier both physically and mentally. 
                    My perspective has definitely changed in many ways. </p> 
		    <p>I’ve met many new people and made many new friends, and each has had some level of impact on me, no matter how big or small, whether 
                    someone helped me out or simply helped me relax in times of stress. And of course, I’ve also seen my fair share of darker days. These 
		    also still had an impact on me, and helped me grow as a person.
                    I’ve learned plenty of lessons through mistakes and experiences. They also helped shape me, so I wouldn’t have 
                    it any other way.</p>
                    <p>I don’t know if 2018 will “be my year.”
		    <br>
		    But I do know that I am ready to make the most of it.</p>
                  	<p>So you may be wondering why I’m writing this post. I want to encourage you to reflect on your past year and 
                    think about how much you’ve developed. Then think about what you need to work on to satisfy your expectations of 
                    yourself, to be the best you that you can be.</p>
                    <p>I’m not talking about something like a New Year’s Resolution, (nobody sticks to them anyways) but think about 
                    what can you do to really improve your outlook on your life, and overall your experience in this past year. 
                    And try to meet that personal expectation of yourself to make the most of 2018.</p>
                    <p>We all have things we plan on getting to but never do. The goals you set but never work towards. Impossible 
                    projects that seem like a distant dream. Start working towards them, and those dreams will become clearer and 
                    clearer as you work. Your ideas will come to fruition. All it takes is motivation to get you there. </p>
                    <p>I’ll leave you with this. Reflect. What can you do to make the most out of this next year?</p>
                    <p>Who knows? 2018 might be your year.</p>
