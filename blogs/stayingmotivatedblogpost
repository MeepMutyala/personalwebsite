                    <blogpost> <a href="blogs/heresto2018.html"><h1>Staying Motivated, Driven, and Focused.</h1></a>
                    <br>
                    <p>I’ve recently been finding it hard to keep up with my work. And the problem wasn’t just that I’ve been tired 
                    or can’t focus, although those are definitely factors. Read on, and I’ll tell you how this relates to you.</p>
	
                    <p><b>I’ve been facing a dilemma.</b></p> 
                    
                    <p>There is so much I want to do. Beyond just making it through high school and college and finding a decent job, 
                    I have goals that I’m not sure I can accomplish. Basically, I know the things I want to accomplish, but I’m 
                    paralyzed. Sometimes I sit there and can’t think of what to do or I feel so overwhelmed that I don’t know where 
                    to begin. “How can I do all of this?” “What’s the path that I can take to accomplish this?” “What’s my place?” 
                    “How do I make an impact?” </p> 
		                <p>“What’s the point?”</p>
                    <p><b><i>“If your actions inspire others to dream more, learn more, do more and become more, you are a leader.”
	                  <br>-John Quincy Adams
                    </i></b></p>
                  	<p>Not for the sake of being a leader, but to know I’ve left a mark, my single greatest goal in life is to make 
                    an impact on others by motivating people to achieve their goals. If we are all driven enough to achieve our dreams, 
                    and we work hard enough to do so, there’s absolutely nothing that we, as humans, cannot achieve. The possibilities 
                    are endless. I’m determined to get the ball rolling, inspiring and motivating others to become the best versions of 
                    themselves and strive for growth. There is no greater satisfaction than knowing you have grown as a person. 
                    Satisfaction, whether through accomplishment or through simply having a good time is what I believe leads to 
                    happiness. </p>
                    <p>A while ago I spoke to a friend (who started a new project of their own) about how there aren’t many young people 
                    who are driven enough to start working to pursue their passions. Of course, you have to find your passions and 
                    interests before anything, but I personally don’t think there are enough people who make enough of an effort to 
                    branch out and explore. This may be a fault of my own. I think it’s extremely important for people to be empowered 
                    and be able to find their passions and interests, so they can dream, expand their limits and become fulfilled.
                    </p>
                    <p>Coming back to what I talked about earlier, I’ve had a lot on my mind as to how I want to accomplish this. 
                    I want to pursue computer science, and film, and photography, and creative writing, and possibly even politics! 
                    I want to make a name for myself. There are all of these things I want to do, but I have such little time, 
                    especially with these major goals. 
                    </p>
                    <p>What does this have to do with you? Last post, I told you to reflect and think about what you want to do in 
                    the future. I asked you the question, “What can you do to make the most out of this next year?” Have you thought 
                    about it? What have you done so far?
                    </p>
                    <p>Like I previously mentioned, I’ve been feeling slightly overwhelmed with how much I take on. I can sit down to 
                    do work, but have no idea where to start or how to begin. I end up delaying and procrastinating.
                    </p>
                    <p>A part of the problem, in fact, is procrastination. I, probably much like many of you reading, procrastinate a 
                    lot. I’ve observed that for me, motivation doesn’t kick in until the last minute when I need to finish something. 
                    The late nights I’ve had to pull coupled with insomnia on regular nights doesn’t seem to be a great pair. 
                    Procrastination coupled with the high expectations I’ve set create an even more dreadful combination.
                    </p> 
		                <p>Someone told me I need to take smaller steps. One or two things at a time. Plan for the future, 
                    but don’t stress as much about it. This really made me realize something.
                    </p>
                    <p>We may have a lot to do, but not enough deadlines to worry us about these problems and to process the severity 
                    of situations. For example, you could have a huge application due sometime soon, but because you don’t think about 
                    it until it comes closer, you think you can just work on it later, and you don’t start working on it until the last 
                    minute. </p>
                  	<p>If we set smaller deadlines for what to finish in the moment, say this week, it’s much easier to not get 
                    overwhelmed or procrastinate due to portioning the work ahead of time, so you don’t have to do it all at once 
                    right before it’s due.
                    </p>
                    <p>If you struggle with procrastination or lack of motivation, follow these steps:</p>
                    <ol>
                    <li>Create a calendar.</li>
                    <p>Start a blank calendar. It’s optimal if it’s physical and you can place it somewhere in your workspace where 
                    you can always see it. (If not, just be sure to check it often.) Start organizing this calendar by placing the 
                    major due dates for your projects, and when you’d like them to be completely finished. Then, start portioning your 
                    project. Taking our earlier application example, you could say, “I want to finish this essay by ___.” or “I want to 
                    finish the formal paper work by ____.” Set some work for time intervals to help you accomplish some work effectively 
                    between now and the due date so you have a plan on what to accomplish and how to do so. You won’t feel as overwhelmed.</p>
                    <li>Share your calendar.</li>
                    <p>If you’ve portioned progress on your projects correctly, start sharing them! Just one person is enough. You may 
                    ask, “Apu, why would I share my plans with someone else?” Let me ask you two more questions. How many times have you 
                    told yourself you would do something, and didn’t do it? Now how many times have you told someone else you would do 
                    something, and you didn’t do it? Definitely fewer failures when you told someone else. Sharing your plans and 
                    deadlines helps you stick to them because it adds the extra pressure of having to meet the expectations of someone 
                    else. You psychologically trick yourself into working more efficiently. </p>
                    <p>Whether it’s a friend, teacher, client, or even your mom or dad, talk to people and share certain deadlines 
                    with them. Trust me, you will work a lot more productively.</p>
                    <p>	Let’s use another example. If you’re working with a client, and you need to finish a project for them, 
                    SET A DEADLINE! Even if they don’t require it, insist to do so. Without a deadline, procrastination is 
                    inevitable, which means you won’t work on it anytime soon. You want to set that deadline. The pressure will make 
                    you work on it.</p> 
                    <li>Set a schedule.</li>
		                <p>This is especially important if you want to do certain things every day as part of a routine. Schedule some time 
                    each day to work on whatever you need to do and update your calendar. Get into the practice of doing it every day
                    (or however long the intervals are) and you will soon get in the habit and it will be extremely beneficial to you 
                    in the long run.</p>
                    <p>The final message I want to make clear is that you should constantly be improving on yourself, finding the 
                    motivation to work on your projects, discovering new things, and becoming a better person in the process. Don’t 
                    focus on the arbitrary things in life, focus on what you can do. If you struggle with finding the time to do so, 
                    commit and jump in! You’re never going to start unless you take that leap of faith. Start scheduling, planning, 
                    and setting small goals, and you’ll accomplish big achievements in no time.</p>
                  	<p>As for me, I am beginning to take the small steps that will hopefully translate to a successful journey. 
                    In my TSA chapter, I’m mentoring students in hopes of motivating them to dream bigger and strive for greater 
                    things. I’m reaching out to people, and am now learning, collaborating, and networking with them. I am proud to 
                    say that I’m making the most of the opportunities that come my way.</p>
                    <p>I’m accomplishing my goals, and growing as a person as I do so. I wish the same for you.</p>
                    <p>
