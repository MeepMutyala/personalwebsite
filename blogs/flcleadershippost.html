                    <blogpost> <a href="blogs/flcleadershippost.html"><h1>A Reflection on Leadership/The Fall Leadership Conference!</h1></a>
                    <br>
                   	<p>This past week, I’ve truly reflected on what it really means to be a leader.</p>
	
                  	<p>It may sound simple. A leader is someone guides a group towards a goal. But breaking it down, it gets much, 
                    much more complicated.</p> 
                    <p>You may lead a group, but why? What’s motivating you? How do you get past the challenges?</p>
                    <p>I answered this question while writing a short essay last weekend. The prompt I was given read as, “Describe 
                    the most rewarding and challenging aspect of being a leader in your school and community.” I could go on about
                    why being a leader is rewarding, and it’s various challenging aspects, but unfortunately I was limited to 100 words.</p> 
                  	<p>For me, the most rewarding aspect of being a leader is the satisfaction of finishing a project with a group of 
                    people and celebrating the success of the project. I wrote, “To succeed and feel accomplishment with others, 
                    experience achievement after a great deal of hard work, and observe the impact you made on your community is 
                    very rewarding.” That basically sums up why I grew into a leader. I’ve always wanted to make bigger impacts 
                    and accomplish big things. So finally being able to say, “we did it!” with your team and celebrating your 
                    accomplishments, to me, is the most rewarding part of being a leader.</p>
	                  <p>The most challenging aspect? You’re not always going to find yourself surrounded with people who aspire to be 
                    at the same level you do. I find that in certain situations, and I try to motivate others the best I can. But 
                    it comes down to whether or not they themselves are incentivized to complete the task. So I wasn’t ever sure 
                    how to deal with the problem, if trying to motivate them directly didn’t work. Other times they may be motivated, 
                    but may not know the path to follow to success. I learned later at the Fall Leadership Conference how to handle 
                    these situations, as I explain later in this post.</p>
                  	<p>On Tuesday afternoon, I went down to Dover to meet my fellow state officers and help set up the 2017 CTSO Fall 
                    Leadership Conference at Delaware State University (DSU). We set up the booth for Delaware TSA, unpacked some 
                    neat pens, and checked out the room we were presenting in. My friend and fellow state officer Rishi and I also 
                    exchanged camera lenses and messed around. After setting up, we went to our hotel rooms and we rehearsed our 
                    presentation, even though it seemed we had many times. We discussed the topic we were presenting, a program 
                    called LEAP (Leadership, Education, Achievement, and Personal Growth.) LEAP was a program recently integrated 
                    into TSA last year, and many people were confused about it, so our officer team decided to go over it.</p> 
                  	<p>During our discussions, I realized that LEAP solves the challenges of leadership not only I may encounter, but 
                    anyone can. I won’t go over all the steps of LEAP, so I don’t bore you, but there are two specific ones that 
                    stood out to me, “Inspire A Shared Vision,” and “Enable Others To Act”.  Inspiring a shared vision means to be 
                    able to motivate a group or team through sharing your goals with them, and inspiring them to set it as their 
                    goal too, so you all have a shared vision, and you all work hard towards making that vision a reality. Enabling 
                    others to act means to empower and encourage them, and to use teamwork skills to strengthen the others in your group
                    to take action. These two steps showed how I can motivate and lead a team to success, and show them my vision of the
                    path.</p>
                  	<p>After a night of hard work (and listening to Rishi’s sick EDM/Alternative Spotify playlists), we woke up, got ready, 
                    and ate our breakfast muffins from the hotel. We drove back to DSU, a mile or two away, and went to the opening 
                    ceremony. All the state officer teams from the various organizations were called up, as we introduced ourselves 
                    and welcomed the 600 or so students attending the conference.</p>
                    <p>We walked up on stage, and Tyler took the microphone. “Hello Delaware TSA! The state officer team would like to 
                    welcome you to the Fall Leadership Conference! My name is Tyler Rouwhorst, serving as your State Sergeant-at-Arms.”
                    The microphone was passed from officer to officer as each of us introduced ourselves with our name and position, 
                    and then it came to me. “Hello Delaware TSA, my name is Apu Mutyala, serving as your State Vice-President.” I hear
                    a round of applause.</p>
                    <p>It’s a strange feeling, looking out into that crowd of students and saying those words. It wasn’t my first time 
                    though. The fact that I am impacting an organization with so many students amazes me. It really is an honor to do
                    so.</p>
                    <p>I passed the microphone on, and then we all walked off the stage. After another round of applause following the 
                    state officers of the other organizations finishing their introductions, Connor, Tyler, Priya, and Rishi left in 
                    a hurry to set up to greet our audience when they came to our room. Skyler and I stayed to help direct the TSA 
                    students to our presentation site across the campus.</p>
                    <p>After arriving at the site, we waited as people settled in, and we presented our seminar. It was pretty 
                    successful, and we went over the 5 practices of being a leader and “Be. Know. Do.” in LEAP.</p>
                    <p>After the audience was dismissed to go to their next workshop, our team rushed to introduce the speaker at 
                    another seminar, and we attended a few others, ate lunch, and relaxed. Rishi and I took pictures of other 
                    presenters. At lunch, we talked about what we did well, what could be improved on, and concluded that our 
                    presentation was a success. Redesigning the whole presentation and changing it completely from the presentations 
                    in the past years, and successfully presenting it made us pretty proud of ourselves.</p>
                    <p>We went to the closing ceremony, cleaned up, and left the campus to get to our hotel. We got to our rooms at 
                    around 4:30. We got into more comfortable clothes, and Rishi, Tyler and I laid around one of our hotel rooms,
                    watched some YouTube videos, and eventually drifted off to sleep from complete exhaustion. We woke up at 6:15 
                    from Rishi’s alarm (thank gosh he set it) and got ready for dinner. After eating dinner, we hung around for a 
                    bit, worked on some homework, and the guys hit the pool.</p>
                    <p>We finally had time to relax and bond as an officer team some more. It became clear that we’ve come a long way
                    since being elected in April. Our team now worked like a well-oiled machine, and we were extremely comfortable
                    with each other. We learned a lot of skills since April, and it was quite visible.</p>
                    <p>We headed to our rooms, hung out a bit more, and then as we were about to head to sleep because it was really 
                    late, Tyler had a suggestion. “20 minute photo challenge!” he exclaimed. Rishi, Tyler, and I pulled out our 
                    DSLR’s and had 20 minutes to photograph, edit, and export a photo to Google Drive. Connor was our timekeeper 
                    and judge. After a few rounds, some “oohs” and “ahs”, we finally went to sleep.</p>
                    <p>The next day we checked out of the hotel, attended the opening ceremony, presented to the middle schoolers, went 
                    to workshops, and took some pictures, all yet again. We hung out with the Delaware BPA state officer team, played
                    some ice breakers, and then we again cleaned up the conference, took some pictures, and headed to our homes from 
                    there.</p>
                    <p>All in all, it really was an amazing experience. I made many new connections and had loads of fun with the other 
                    officers. I’ve never realized how much I can learn from teaching others, and this past week I’ve reflected on my 
                    leadership skills and experiences more than ever. Improving my leadership skills has been my focus for a while and 
                    now it’s grown even stronger. It’s something I’ll continue to improve on as time goes on.</p>
