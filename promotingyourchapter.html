                    <h3>"What are some ways our chapter can be improved upon?"</h3>
                    <p>
                        This is a question you should be asking yourself if you find your chapter is struggling with various problems.
                        I've put together some tips for chapters so they can improve in areas they may struggle in.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Do you find your chapter isn't producing results at your state conference that members are satisfied with?
                        Here are a few options to help you chapter be more successful in your competitions.
                    </p>
                    <h3>Create a Plan of Work.</h3>
                    <p>
                        What's a plan of work? A plan or work, or a "workplan," is a detailed proposal of what work a group will try to accomplish
                        for the year. Workplans are tied to a schedule, so that goals can be organized and completed on time. For TSA, at the chapter
                        level, your workplan can include plans for fundraisers, charity, and overall goals your chapter would like to accomplish.
                    </p>
                    <h3>Competition Checks</h3>
                    <p>
                        You want to get your plans started as soon as possible. After your members receive their event prompts and such, nake sure they
                        schedule their time by creating a calendar and project plan for their events. You may want to schedule, "Competition Checks," in
                        which responsible chapter officers will check on the progress of member's events and if they are not getting work done, help them schedule their time better.
                    </p>
                    <h3>Self Initiative!!!</h3>
                    <p>
                        At the chapter level, you have a lot of freedom to make your chapter the best it can possibly be. The key to really getting
                        your chapter out there is self initiative. I mean organizing fundraisers with your school, asking your school to help promote
                        your chapter, possibly even talking to local companies to sponsor or hold an event to help raise money for you chapter.
                        Get creative! There are many options for you to take, and that leaves a lot of freedom. Of course, you should get the
                        approval of your fellow officers, advisor, and school officials if necessary.
                    </p>
                    <h3>Promote Leadership.</h3>
                    <p>
                        Do you see a lack of leadership and/or self initiative in your chapter? When I saw this in my own chapter, I teamed
                        up with another member of my chapter to create a mentoring program to help younger members develop leadership skills
                        to lead the chapter in the future, whether as an officer or just a general member. If you see a lack of leadership in
                        your chapter and wish to do something about it, check out the mentoring program Tyler Rouwhorst and I co-created.
                        <b>We based the program off of what we thought our chapter needed, so we could improve our chapter for the future. 
                        The outline provided can be modified or changed in many ways, just make a copy on Google Docs. Feel free to take this 
                        template/outline and modify the program to your chapter's needs. </b> Here's the link to the program: <a href="http://bit.ly/2xmvMjj"> TSA Chapter Mentoring Leadership Program</a>
