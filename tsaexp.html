                        <h3>My Experiences in TSA</h3>
                        <p>
                            Joining TSA in the 7th grade, I didn’t know much of what I was getting into. I competed in a lot of clubs at the time,
                            including BPA, Math League, and Science Olympiad. I valued TSA as just another club. Until the State Conference.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Seeing the amount of people there and their dedication to TSA inspired me. People didn't think about the skills they've 
                            learned, or how they could apply them in other clubs. Student's just competed and left. But in TSA, you can compete, participate 
                            in service events, and learn to lead in a technical world. And that drew me in. The amount of passion other people showed for 
                            TSA amazed me, and I decided that TSA was something I wanted to continue, and to work harder in.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Although I didn’t place in any of my events that day, I worked harder the following year. I was elected as my
                            chapter’s President in 8th grade, practiced and worked on my events rigorously, and placed in two of my events, what
                            seemed to be a tremendous accomplishment to me.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            When I entered freshman year of high school, I attended my chapter’s TSA interest meeting. The meeting was led by
                            a state officer who attends our school, whose name is Tyler Rouwhorst. I met him at the state conference the previous
                            year, when he talked to me to win my vote over. Little did I know, that Tyler would later inspire me to run for state
                            office too.
                        </p>
                        <p>After considering it for a while, I decided to run for state office.
                        <p>
                            Over the next few months I worked hard on a few events, but primarily on my campaign and at the state conference.
                            I was elected as the Vice President of Delaware TSA. This was an achievement I was certainly proud of, and it marked
                            only the beginning of my future in TSA.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            As Vice President, I learned a lot and made a lot of memories with my officer team. I created new logos for Delaware TSA, 
                            launched the DETSA Instagram, spread the mentoring program I created to other chapters in the state, and worked to help 
                            empower other students to achieve their greatest potential, inside or outside of TSA. Many people dubbed me "obsessed" which I 
                            wouldn't deny. I was working extremely hard to leave a lasting impact on my state, and model the way for other students to follow.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I mentored younger students in my chapter, one of which became the State Treasurer the following year. At the 2018 state conference, 
                            I was elected again as State Vice President, was met with a new team, (placed in my events of course) , and again got on the grind to 
                            help create a better future for Delaware TSA.  
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I competed at the National Conference again, and ended up finalizing in one of my events. It was my second national conference, and my favorite. 
                            As we rushed in and out of hotels in Atlanta, I met some great people from around the nation and was able to form long lasting relationships with them.
                            It was really amazing to meet people from all over who had one common interest: TSA. Even if they weren't into either leadership, STEM, or service specifically,
                            we all had interests that attracted us to this amazing organization that could allow us to achieve our dreams.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           So now I serve again as the 2018-2019 State Vice President. My main project this year was creating a program called the <b> State Committee Mentoring Program</b>, or SCMP 
                            for short. One of the most important things I learned from having a mentor was that the best way to learn leadership or technical skills was to 
                            work with someone towards a common goal. There are some things you can only learn through experience and hands on working, and leadership is one of them. 
                            SCMP allows students from across the state to join our state's committees and help Delaware TSA accomplish our goals more efficiently with higher quality. 
                            Increasing our workforce while taking students who are ready to get hands on with challenges is proving to be a great way to mentor leadership in students as well as 
                            helping us achieve our goals more effectively.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                          What's in store for the future? I honestly have no idea. My life has taken quite a few twists and turns recently, so I've learned to accept that I can't always control my future. 
                            But I can always work to shape it, and help shape it for others around me, so we can be empowered and able to create a better future for the world ahead of us.
                        </p>
