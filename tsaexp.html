                        <h3>My Experiences in TSA</h3>
                        <p>
                            Joining TSA in the 7th grade, I didn’t know much of what I was getting into. I competed in a lot of clubs at the time,
                            including BPA, Math League, and Science Olympiad. I valued TSA as just another club. Until the State Conference.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Seeing the amount of people there and their dedication to TSA inspired me. The amount of effort other put in their
                            events amazed me, and I decided that TSA was something I wanted to continue, and to work harder in.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Although I didn’t place in any of my events that day, I worked harder the following year. I was elected as my
                            chapter’s President in 8th grade, practiced and worked on my events rigorously, and placed in two of my events, what
                            seemed to be a tremendous accomplishment to me.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            When I entered freshman year of high school, I attended my chapter’s TSA interest meeting. The meeting was led by
                            a state officer who attends our school, whose name is Tyler Rouwhorst. I met him at the state conference the previous
                            year, when he talked to me to win my vote over. Little did I know, that Tyler would later inspire me to run for state
                            office too.
                        </p>
                        <p>After considering it for a while, I decided to run for state office.
                        <p>
                            Over the next few months I worked hard on a few events, but primarily on my campaign and at the state conference.
                            I was elected as the Vice-President of Delaware TSA. This was an achievement I am certainly proud of, and it marked
                            only the beginning of my future in TSA.
                        </p>
