                    <h3>Technology Student Association</h3>
                    <p>The Technology Student Association is a Career and Technical Student Organization (CTSO) that promotes technology and inspire students to learn more about STEM. Innovations and technology are starting to define the world around us and evolve at rapid rates. TSA prepares students to define their futures with technology.</p>
                    <p>TSA has a number of competitive events that students can compete in to build and prove their skills. Each state has a conference, and the winners from the state conferences can move on to compete in the National Conference in June. Students can also participate in many charity and fundraising events through TSA, to help those in need through the American Cancer Society (ACS) or to help a chapter grow.</p>
                    <p>I joined TSA in the 7th grade, becoming my chapter’s secretary, and then President the following year. After serving as chapter Parliamentarian as a freshman, I now serve as the State Vice President for Delaware TSA, as a sophomore in high school. TSA has had a huge impact on my life, as it taught me many skills in various technical fields, as well as teaching me leadership and responsibility.</p>
                    <h3>Benefits of Joining TSA</h3>
                    <p>Joining a club such as as TSA has many benefits, that can help students throughout their life. Here are just a few.</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Enhance technological literacy and leadership skills.</li>
                        <li>Network with students and teachers with similar interests from all over the United States.</li>
                        <li>Compete on local, state and national levels.</li>
                        <li>Have a voice in a national organization that is helping to shape the future of technology education.</li>
