                    <h3>Who am I?</h3>
                    <p> Hi there, I'm Apu. I'm a highschooler with big ideas. I have a lot of interests, between photography, coding, music, and more.</p>
                    <h3>Photography</h3>
                    <p>
                        My passion for photography likely originated from when I visited India at the age of 11.
                        Because I was so attached to technology and video games as a young child, I found everything there to be so boring.
                        I didn’t have much to do other than visiting family and talking to my cousins.
                        My dad had brought his brand new (at the time) DSLR on our trip, a Nikon D7000.
                        When we were at a family party, he asked me take photos. After he showed me how to use it,
                        I went ahead and did so. Of course, I had taken photos before on other devices, but I was fascinated
                        by what I could capture with this camera.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I strayed away from photography and actually became interested in videography, and competed
                        in a few competitions as time went on. Then I started learning more about camera techniques and
                        cinematography as a whole in the middle of my freshman year of high school. Up until then it was
                        pretty slow, but my interest and time spent on cinematography skyrocketed from that point.
                        While balancing my schoolwork and clubs, in my free time you can find me taking photos or observing other's work.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Here I am in the present, and I’m still always looking to improve, but I’d like to say I’ve become pretty good
                        at what I do. And I guarantee you’ll be satisfied.
                    </p>
